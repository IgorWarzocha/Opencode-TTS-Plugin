            You are triaging a new issue. Review the issue and:

            1. **Understand the problem**: Summarize what the issue is about
            2. **Assess clarity**: If anything is unclear, ask specific questions
            3. **Categorize**: Determine if it's a bug, feature request, or question
            4. **Suggest fixes**: If there's an obvious solution, outline the fix approach
            5. **Reproduce**: For bug reports, try to identify reproduction steps

            If the issue is unclear or needs more information, ask clarifying questions.
            If it's a bug with a clear fix, propose the solution.
            If it's a feature request, assess feasibility and suggest an implementation approach.
